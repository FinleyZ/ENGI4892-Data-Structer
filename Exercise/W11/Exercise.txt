Exercises for 20 Jul 2020 (Shortest Paths)

1.Using the algorithm in the Shortest Paths video and the data from Fridayâ€™s exercises,
  calculate (by hand) the distances from Portugal Cove to all other locations in the table.
  - st.johns  14.2
  	Paradise  12.5
  	Goulds    28.5
  	CBS       16.4
  	Bay Bulls 43.8
  	HOLYROOD  75.7
  	Portugal  0

 2.Write out and analyze the asymptotic run-time complexity of the algorithm we saw for computing shortest
 paths through graphs with unweighted edges in our introductory video on the topic, ( also presented here),
  as well as the version that uses a work list to store "non-done" vertices. If necessary, you may find it
  helpful to refer back to the analyses we did in class on Wednesday.
