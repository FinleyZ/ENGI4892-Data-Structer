1. Demonstrate that the stack used to store C++ functions' local variables grows downwards.
	- Demonstrated in main.cpp file.
	- the output show below, but not sure local variables grows downwards in stack
		0x7ffee2acbaa8
        0x7ffee2acba88
        0x7ffee2acba68
        0x7ffee2acba48
        0x7ffee2acba28

2. The reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a notation for expressing mathematical operations without
   requiring parentheses. Unlike infix notation (e.g., 1+2), calculations can be done in a single
   pass through the token stream — no additional parsing is required.Write a function that accepts
   a pair of iterators over a container of strings (e.g., { "1", "2", "+", "3", "*" }) and that
   returns an integer derived from an RPN interpretation of the strings (in the example above, 9).
