Exercises for 1 Jun 2020
	1. Write the pseudocode for an algorithm that will remove all of the numbers from a
	   list that are multiples of 10. Analyze its asymptotic complexity.

			for iterator = list.begin, i!= lest.end, i++
				if(*iterator % 10 = 0){
					erase list position iterator pointed
				}

			asymptotic complexity is O(n)

	2. Modify the above algorithm to remove the same numbers from a vector instead of a list.
	   Analyze its asymptotic complexity.

	   		for i = vector.begin, i!= vector.end, i++
	   			for j = i + 1, i!= vector.end, i++
            		if(verctor[i] = verctor[j]){
            			erase vector[j]
            		}

			asymptotic complexity is O(n^2)

	2. Implement your algorithms using the std::list and std::vector class templates.
	   Time their execution for varying sizes of lists and vectors to conform your theoretical analysis.
